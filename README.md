# Weather-App
This is file that contains the front-end code for a weather application called "SkyUpdate". It utilizes the Bootstrap 4.5.0 CSS library and the AOS (Animate On Scroll) CSS library.

The file contains a navbar, a container, and multiple divs with different classes to display the weather information. The user can input a location in the "city-input" text box and click the "Search" button to get the weather information for that location.

The "weather-card" class displays the weather icon, temperature, and other details such as location, date, and Celsius unit. The "all-cards" class displays additional weather information such as maximum and minimum temperature, humidity, wind speed, and pressure.

The front-end code interacts with a JavaScript file called "app.js" to fetch the weather data and display it on the HTML page.
